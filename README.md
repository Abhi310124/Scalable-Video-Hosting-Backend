# Scalable-Video-Hosting-Backend

This repository contains the backend source code for a scalable video hosting platform. The backend is designed to handle large volumes of video uploads, transcoding, storage, and streaming with a focus on scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Video Upload:** Securely accept large video files from users.
- **Transcoding:** Convert videos to multiple formats and resolutions for adaptive streaming.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Store videos on scalable cloud storage providers.
- **Streaming:** Efficient delivery of videos using HTTP streaming protocols.
- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure endpoints and manage user permissions.
- **API-Driven Architecture:** RESTful APIs for easy frontend and service integration.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Track system health and debug production issues.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** (Please specify: Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Cloud Storage:** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Transcoding:** (e.g., FFmpeg)
- **Authentication:** (e.g., JWT, OAuth)
- **Containerization:** (e.g., Docker)

- **utils/**: Helper functions and utilities.
- **config/**: Configuration files and environment settings.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abhi310124/Scalable-Video-Hosting-Backend.git
   cd Scalable-Video-Hosting-Backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required settings.

4. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```sh
   npm test
   # or
   yarn test
   ```

## Remaining Work

There are still models in the `models` directory that need to be completed. Please review the files in `models/` and implement the missing model definitions as required for the application.
